Your home directory is backed up nightly on kepler. Currently, we don't impose a disk quota. There are many users on both systems and we do have limited space, so we ask that you delete files that you are not using. 

There is space on kepler for large file storage and scratch space on the nodes. The path to the space is **/mnt/xfs/ and /xfs2** . You can create your own directory there. Please note that the space on /mnt/xfs/ is **not** backed up. It is also **not** meant for long term storage.
