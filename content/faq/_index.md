# FAQ

<br>

**What exactly is high-performance computing, and what are the applications?**

High-performance computing (HPC) is using computer clusters to solve advanced computing problems. The problems include analysis of large data sets and complex computational problems. Here is a quick introduction to <u>[high-performance computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer)</u>.

**What services does the Advanced Technology Group offer the Saint Louis University Community?**

We offer a variety of services that include:

<li style="PADDING-LEFT:20px">Creation of accounts on the high performance computing cluster.</li>
<li style="PADDING-LEFT:20px">Installation of software on the high performance computing cluster, and hardware advice for high performance computing applications.</li>
<li style="PADDING-LEFT:20px">Consultation on, and hardware advice for high performance computing applications.</li>

**What are the requirements for an account on the HPC, and how do I get one?**

You must currently be a member of the Saint Louis University faculty. Or, you must be working with a faculty member on a research project. If this is the case, the faculty member will have to make the request on your behalf. The link for the account request form is listed below:

**Is there a cost associated with using the HPC?**

Currently, there is no cost unless you would need dedicated resources. 

**Who do I contact if I would like more information?**

Please contact <u><a href="mailto:kaufmann@slu.edu">Eric Kaufmann</a></u> if you have any questions. 

**Do I need to learn a programming language to use the HPC.**

You don't need to learn a programming language to use the HPC. You might need to learn a certain language to use a specific application or run analysis. The most common languages that are used are bash scripting, python, and R. Here are some links to get you started.

<u>[Bash Academy](https://www.bash.academy/)</u>

<u>[Getting Started in Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)</u>

<u>[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)</u>

 **Note: DataCamp is an excellent place to learn both R and Python.**
