File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to copy a file from one host to another over a TCP/IP-based network, such as the Internet. FTP is built on a client-server architecture and utilizes separate control and data connections between the client and server. FTP users may authenticate themselves using a clear-text sign-in protocol, but they can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it.

One of the easiest FTP applications to use if FileZilla.  The client is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It can be downloaded here: <u>[download FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)</u>.

After you download the client, follow the <u>[installation instructions](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Client_Installation)</u>. You can find the <u>[FileZilla documentation here](https://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Documentation)</u>.

To connect to the cluster you just need to enter the following information. 

    Host: kepler.slu.edu<br>
    Username: Your SLU username<br>
    Password: Your password for kepler.<br>
    Port: 22
